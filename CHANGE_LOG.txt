RELEASE NOTES

This log is mainly for breaking changes.

1.8.0

Breaking changes
- The constructor of the class that is the default export of this module now requires three parameters instead of four. Two of them were combined: the item creator function and the item populator function. The second parameter should now be a function that takes a data object as its parameter and returns an HTML element that is populated with the data.

1.7.0

Breaking changes
- Removed "receiveItem" method. The "addDataItems" method (formerly named "receiveItems") can be used, instead. Note that it takes an array.
- Renamed "receiveItems" method to "addDataItems".
